  abstract = {Educators face major challenges as a result of the shift from the Information Age to the Experience Age (Wadhera, 2016). For example, students are passive and disengaged (Capps and Crawford, 2013) and may struggle to see the relevance of what they are learning to their lives (Gee, 2009); also, important skills needed for 21st century learners – such as empathy, systems thinking, creativity, computational literacy, and abstract reasoning – are difficult to teach (Smith and Hu, 2013). Virtual reality, an immersive, hands-on tool for learning, can play a unique role in addressing these educational challenges. In this paper, we present examples of how the affordances of virtual reality lead to new opportunities that support learners. We conclude with a discussion of recommendations and next steps.}

    abstract = {This study is a ten-year critical review of empirical research on the educational applications of Virtual Reality (VR). Results show that although the majority of the 53 reviewed articles refer to science and mathematics, researchers from social sciences also seem to appreciate the educational value of VR and incorporate their learning goals in Educational Virtual Environments (EVEs). Although VR supports multisensory interaction channels, visual representations predominate. Few are the studies that incorporate intuitive interactivity, indicating a research trend in this direction. Few are the settings that use immersive EVEs reporting positive results on users’ attitudes and learning outcomes, indicating that there is a need for further research on the capabilities of such systems. Features of VR that contribute to learning such as first order experiences, natural semantics, size, transduction, reification, autonomy and presence are exploited according to the educational context and content. Presence seems to play an important role in learning and it is a subject needing further and intensive studies. Constructivism seems to be the theoretical model the majority of the EVEs are based on. The studies present real world, authentic tasks that enable context and content dependent knowledge construction. They also provide multiple representations of reality by representing the natural complexity of the world. Findings show that collaboration and social negotiation are not only limited to the participants of an EVE, but exist between participants and avatars, offering a new dimension to computer assisted learning. Little can yet be concluded regarding the retention of the knowledge acquired in EVEs. Longitudinal studies are necessary, and we believe that the main outcome of this study is the future research perspectives it brings to light.}

A total of 13 studies (N = 3081) in the category of games, 29 studies (N = 2553) in the category of games, and 27 studies (N = 2798) in the category of virtual worlds were meta-analyzed. The key inclusion criteria were that the study came from K-12 or higher education settings, used experimental or quasi-experimental research designs, and used a learning outcome measure to evaluate the effects of the virtual reality-based instruction. Results suggest games (FEM = 0.77; REM = 0.51), simulations (FEM = 0.38; REM = 0.41), and virtual worlds (FEM = 0.36; REM = 0.41) were effective in improving learning outcome gains. The homogeneity analysis of the effect sizes was statistically significant, indicating that the studies were different from each other. Therefore, we conducted moderator analysis using 13 variables used to code the studies. Key findings included that: games show higher learning gains than simulations and virtual worlds. For simulation studies, elaborate explanation type feedback is more suitable for declarative tasks whereas knowledge of correct response is more appropriate for procedural tasks. Students performance is enhanced when they conduct the game play individually than in a group. In addition, we found an inverse relationship between number of treatment sessions learning gains for games. With regards to the virtual world, we found that if students were repeatedly measured it deteriorates their learning outcome gains. We discuss results to highlight the importance of considering instructional design principles when designing virtual reality-based instruction.}

This paper adopts the literature analysis method, focusing on the application of VR technology in the field of higher education, selects 80 empirical studies in theWeb of Science literature database, conducts in-depth reading and analysis of the papers, and summarizes the experience of applying VR technology in the field of higher education. In order to deepen the application of VR in higher education. The research results show that the research objects of VR application in higher education are mainly undergraduates, the main majors of application are science, engineering and medical related majors, and the application of humanities and social sciences is relatively rare. At present, the devices used for VR in higher education are mainly computers and headsets, which are not portable enough. In addition, students lack guidance and training in the use of VR equipment before class. Compared with traditional education, most of the studies show that the application of VR to higher education and teaching has positive effects, mainly by affecting students’ behaviors to affect students’ learning results. The researchers mainly use traditional evaluation methods to evaluate teaching effects, use questionnaires and tests to collect data, and use data analysis methods mainly difference analysis and descriptive analysis. Based on the research results, the researchers put forward some suggestions at the end of the paper.}

  abstract = {Virtual Reality (vr) has made significant inroads into both the consumer and professional sectors. As vr has matured as a technology, its overall practicality for use in education has also increased. However, due to the rapid evolution of the technology, the educational field struggles to stay informed of the latest advancements, changing affordances, and pedagogical applications. Even the authors’ own 2018 work that categorized vr technology for different educational applications, is no longer completely applicable to the current educational landscape. Though education struggles to keep up with technological developments, both researchers and practitioners have been contributing to a growing body of knowledge and experience. Accordingly, this article explores the progress of vr in educational research and classroom practice through three key questions: (1) What benefits does vr offer for education?, (2) What are the challenges to applying vr in an educational context?, and (3) Has vr matured to a point where it is useful for a wide range of educational purposes? Through a review of literature published from 2017– 2020, the authors explore these questions to provide a snapshot of how vr is being used in classrooms and educational research. The authors conclude with predictions for the future and suggestions for future research.}

The fifth-grade students (N = 111) who were enrolled in this study were divided into an experimental and a control group. The experimental group (N = 56) received SAILS instruction, whereas the control group (N = 55) received traditional instruction. The results indicated that students who received SAILS instruction exhibited better performance on both immediate and maintained surface-area learning achievement tests compared to those who received traditional instruction; furthermore, this effect was more prominent among boys than girls. Low-and moderate-ability students who received SAILS instruction exhibited significantly greater improvement of attitudes toward learning mathematics compared to those receiving traditional instruction with physical teaching aids.}

  abstract = {Why do poor and minority students under-perform in school? Do computer games help or hinder learning? What can new research in psychology teach our educational policy-makers?In this major new book, Gee tackles the 'big ideas' about language, literacy and learning, putting forward an integrated theory that crosses disciplinary boundaries, and applying it to some of the very real problems that face educationalists today.Situated Language and Learning looks at the specialist academic varieties of language that are used in disciplines such as mathematics and the sciences. It argues that the language acquisition process needed to learn these forms of language is not given enough attention by schools, and that this places unfair demands on poor and minority students.The book compares this with learning as a process outside the classroom, applying this idea to computer and video games, and exploring the particular processes of learning which take place as a child interacts with others and technology to learn and play. In doing so, Gee examines what video games can teach us about how to improve learning in schools and engages with current debates on subjects such as 'communities of practice' and 'digital literacies'.Bringing together the latest research from a number of disciplines, Situated Language and Learning is a bold and controversial book by a leading figure in the field, and is essential reading for anyone interested in education and language.}

  abstract = {This article explores the potential learning benefits of three-dimensional (3-D) virtual learning environments (VLEs). Drawing on published research spanning two decades, it identifies a set of unique characteristics of 3-D VLEs, which includes aspects of their representational fidelity and aspects of the learner–computer interactivity they facilitate. A review of applications of 3-D VLEs is presented, leading to the identification of a series of learning affordances of such environments. These affordances include the facilitation of tasks that lead to enhanced spatial knowledge representation, greater opportunities for experiential learning, increased motivation/engagement, improved contextualisation of learning and richer/more effective collaborative learning as compared to tasks made possible by 2-D alternatives. The authors contend that the continued development of and investment in 3-D games, simulations and virtual worlds for educational purposes should be considered contingent on further investigation into the precise relationships between the unique characteristics of 3-D VLEs and their potential learning benefits. To this end, they conclude by proposing an agenda or ‘roadmap’ for future research that encompasses empirical studies aimed at exploring these relationships, as well as those aimed at deriving principles and guidelines to inform the design, development and use of 3-D virtual environments for learning.}

  abstract = {The man who works recognizes his own product in the World that has actually been transformed by his work: He recognizes himself in it, he sees in it his own human reality, in it he discovers and reveals to others the objective reality of his humanity, of the originally abstract and purely subjective idea he has of himself. Alexandre Kojève (Citation1980, 27)
  The essay critiques an aspect of the so-called post-mobile wave of technological change that claims, through the vector of virtual reality (VR), to have created an ‘empathy machine’ that will form the basis of a new journalism. Through VR devices deployed by news organisations such as the New York Times, and multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, users will be so powerfully immersed in, for example, a street demonstration, or a refugee camp, that the empathy they feel may constitute a new strengthening of the fourth estate’s civic role in informing and enlightening the public, to the extent that it can go beyond subjective empathy to develop a shared basis for political participation in civil society. The essay considers these claims from the overarching context of what is called digitality. It argues that human agents are analogue agents from an analogue world. Digitality, by contrast, is an essentially alienating sphere wherein digital media cannot replicate analogue communication processes without generating gaps, voids, and ‘missing information’. It further argues, extending insights from Guy Debord, that what VR does produce is a powerful ‘integrated spectacle’ that is a pale substitute for the form of interactive experience needed for the generation of empathy. Taken together, the essay concludes that empathy, a contestable term in its common understanding to begin with, cannot be generated from a digital source. Moreover, should VR become the next dominant post-mobile technological wave as the tech giants predict, then people, users and consumers of VR products in the fourth estate news context, will be further distanced from the analogue reality of the actual world.}

    abstract = { This article illustrates the utility of using virtual environments to transform social interaction via behavior and context, with the goal of improving learning in digital environments. We first describe the technology and theories behind virtual environments and then report data from 4 empirical studies. In Experiment 1, we demonstrated that teachers with augmented social perception (i.e., receiving visual warnings alerting them to students not receiving enough teacher eye gaze) were able to spread their attention more equally among students than teachers without augmented perception. In Experiments 2 and 3, we demonstrated that by breaking the rules of spatial proximity that exist in physical space, students can learn more by being in the center of the teacher's field of view (compared to the periphery) and by being closer to the teacher (compared to farther away). In Experiment 4, we demonstrated that inserting virtual co-learners who were either model students or distracting students changed the learning abilities of experiment participants who conformed to the virtual co-learners. Results suggest that virtual environments will have a unique ability to alter the social dynamics of learning environments via transformed social interaction.

In this paper, 10 simulation softwares with their main features and developers of these tools are discussed, the softwares studied are SAM, PVsyst, HOMER, PV*SOL, RETScreen, Solarius PV, HelioScope, Solar Pro, SOLARGIS, and PV F-Chart. The main objectives of this paper are to highlight researchers to identify the suitable software for research analysis and to perform degradation and performance analysis of PV power plant. A case study on performance analysis of I MW grid-connected PV solar power plant has been carried out using these simulation tools. Simulation results are then compared with actual data of the power plant to identify the suitable and most effective softwares for research and development. The annual average Performance Ratio (PR) and Capacity Utilization Factor (CUF) were found to be 0.7737 and 14.57% respectively. The PR was then used to determine the annual degradation rate of the PV plant which is found to be 0.98%/year. The defects in the power plant were analyzed to identify various degradation modes of PV modules. Encapsulant discoloration, glass shattering and deposited dust have been seen in few modules. The current status, abilities, limitations, and availability of all the software have also been presented. Homer, SAM, RETScreen and PVsyst are found to be the best and suitable software for performance analysis. There is a need for some improvements on these softwares like allowing the user to modify or change some techniques and incorporation of extensive meteorological and PV system components database. This study is useful for further study on degradation and performance analysis of PV power plant and a comparison of various PV simulation tools in order to identify the most suitable software.}

An analysis methodology was applied to appropriately filter, classify and normalize the data in order to identify the modules temperature coefficients as a function of irradiance and to compare their actual efficiency with those declared by the manufacturer. Acquired data and mathematical correlations will allow the development of accurate simulation models, useful for assessing the actual profitability of similar installations. The latter can be obtained through the main performance indices of the systems that are calculated and reported in this paper for the period of observation.}

    abstract={Virtual Reality (VR) technology has been shown to achieve remarkable results in multiple fields. Due to the nature of the immersive medium of Virtual Reality it logically follows that it can be used as a high-quality educational tool as it offers potentially a higher bandwidth than other mediums such as text, pictures and videos. This short paper illustrates the development of a climate change educational awareness application for virtual reality to simulate virtual scenes of local scenery and sea level rising until 2100 using prediction data. The paper also reports on the current in progress work of porting the system to Augmented Reality (AR) and future work to evaluate the system.}
